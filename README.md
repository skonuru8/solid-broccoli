# React Flappy Bird

This repository contains a simple Flappy Bird clone built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Use the keyboard or mouse to make the bird fly and avoid the pipes.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd flappy-bird
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to play the game.

To create a production build run `npm run build` and deploy the files in the `dist/` folder to any static hosting provider.
